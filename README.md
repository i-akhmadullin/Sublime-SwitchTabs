# SwitchTabs for Sublime Text 2

This plugin allows to quickly switch between files in different tabs.<br>
All you need to know is tab number and file number relative to tab (this way proves to be more intuitive and faster to me). 


##Usage

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + \<tab_number\> + \<file_number\><br>
So if you want to switch to third file in second tab<br>
press <kbd>Ctrl+2+3</kbd> instead of <kbd>Ctrl+2</kbd>, <kbd>Alt+3</kbd><br>


## Examples
<kbd>Ctrl+2+1</kbd> - 1st file in 2nd tab<br>
<kbd>Ctrl+1+1</kbd> - 1st file in 1st tab<br>
<kbd>Ctrl+3+3</kbd> - 3rd file in 3rd tab
